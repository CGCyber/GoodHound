# Sample Database
Here lies a sample Sharphound output taken using [Detection Lab](https://detectionlab.network/) populating with [Bad Blood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood).

BadBlood can't create any session data and so it's not truly represtative of a real domain, however it can be used to play around with GoodHound if you so desire. Import it into Bloodhound using the upload data button.
